# I'm sick of setting up iterm2 all the time.
Lets create a cool profile settings file so we don't have to do it over and over.
Because terminal settings files are cool. Right? Right!?

Feel free to add whatever. Gimme yo cool shit!

So far:
 - Like infinite scroll
 - toggle light/dark 
 - "Quake mode"

- cmd+~ : opens the terminal, Quake-like.
- cmd+shift+l : Light color scheme.
- cmd+shift+d : Dark color scheme.
